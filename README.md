This repository contains our solution code for the assignment in the course COMP.CS.320 - Data-Intensive Programming, 2022 Fall implementation.

We chose to do the project in Scala, as we had both been using that for the exercises during the course (and the bonus point was nice, too).
We did also want to implement all of the additional tasks on top of the basic tasks, which we did.

The most notable additions on top of the implementations in Assignment.scala are the new ninth test we added to test dirty data, and the addition of breeze-viz and breeze-natives (both version 1.3 for compatibility) modules for the visualization.
